# C4DToWebSceneExport
a recipe for export scene &amp; animation data to web

## How to use?

1. Export DAE from Cinema 4D and save it to 3d/input
2. run `gulp dae`
3. the process will generate two files: [filename]-animation.js and [filename]-scene.js
5. scene.js file is generated by the python script by @zfedoran / http://github.com/zfedoran. (slightly modified to output shorter float numbers, and different handling for textures. )
6. load scene.js file into ur THREE.js app, and use the Animation class to interpret the data in animation.js.
